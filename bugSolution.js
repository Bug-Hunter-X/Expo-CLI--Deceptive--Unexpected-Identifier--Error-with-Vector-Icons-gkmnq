The solution is straightforward: install the missing icon set package.  Use the Expo CLI to install the required icon set package:

```bash
expo install @expo/vector-icons@13.0.0 @expo/vector-icons@12.0.0
```

After installation, the import statements will work correctly.  Ensure your import statement is accurate, like this for FontAwesome5:

```javascript
import { FontAwesome5 } from '@expo/vector-icons';
```
