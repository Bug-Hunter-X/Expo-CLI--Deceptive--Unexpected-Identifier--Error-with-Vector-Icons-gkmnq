This error typically arises when using Expo's `@expo/vector-icons` package and you attempt to import a specific icon set without explicitly installing it.  For example, if you try to import `FontAwesome5` icons but haven't installed `expo install @expo/vector-icons@13.0.0 @expo/vector-icons@12.0.0`, you encounter this error.  The error message might not be incredibly clear, often just mentioning a missing module or an unexpected identifier, hence its deceptive nature.
